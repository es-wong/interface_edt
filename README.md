# interface_edt
This is a bunch of MatLab scripts used to process EDT-solar cell data.
This repository contains the consitutent scripts for the TAS, DLCP, conductance, and DOS analaysis.
It also contains the visualization scripts (fig1, fig2, etc) that aggregate the data and make pretty plots.

# TAS, DLCP, DOS, conductance, JV scripts
These scripts take the data output of the experiment and transform capacitance and conductance data into a DOS. 
Calculation of all measurment error is done in these scripts and stored in the proper structure (usualy as "parameterX_err")

# EDTmanuscript_figX scripts
These scripts aggregate the data and create properly formatted figures.
